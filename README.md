# my-awful-tests
this is all about the tests i've been doing with HTML with CSS, in vision of making an website on the future for a chef (gastronomy).
i want to use orange as the main color (and the chef liked it), and gradient to make it cute. i'm still thinking about what i will do with the menu bar, but i'm just testing everything c: 
(remembering: i'm still only with html and css, it will not continue ugly that way)
